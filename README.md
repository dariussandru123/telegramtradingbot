Here's something cool I wanted to share. I created a trading bot that's a bit different from what you usually see. It was inspired by the activity in TraderSZ's Telegram group, which is packed with over 80,000 members.
I noticed that when TraderSZ mentions an altcoin, there's a significant swing in its price due to the buy/sell pressure from his followers. So, I set up my bot to automatically read and classify these calls - long or short, new or an update.
What's more, my bot smartly ignores larger, less impactable cryptos like BTC, ETH, or BNB, and doesn't pay attention to TraderSZ's take profit or stop loss levels either. The goal here is to catch the initial surge or drop triggered by the massive community, not the eventual targets set by TraderSZ.
The best part? The bot has achieved a 100% win rate so far. It doesn't use any traditional indicators, just AI technology. It's earned me $4000 in 37 days!
